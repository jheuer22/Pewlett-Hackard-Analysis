# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
In this analysis, we used SQL to sort through the various Employment data from Pewlett-Hackard to find which employees would soon be eligible for retirement in order to help the company plan for their future employment needs. We also looked at longer term employees who would be a good fit for a potential mentorship program. These soon-to-retire employees would were identified as possible mentors to help train and aclimate newer employees into the company. 


## Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

#### Deliverable 1 Results

- Engineers and Staff titles will need to be heavily recruited due to the large amount that are retirement eligible. 
- There will also need to be furhter analysis of the current staff and engineers to see how many current employees are potential Senior Enigneers or Senior Staff. If there is not enough current employees for these positions, then outside recruitment will be necessary in the future.
